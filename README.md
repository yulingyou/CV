I am a dedicated and hardworking person, and I demonstrated these traits while taking full-time classes for a coding academy this year and working part time as a executive assistant simultaneously. During that time, I managed multiple commitments but delivered and performed above my expectations. I want to use my skills and knowledge to make other people's jobs easier and more productive.
